# International Students in Taiwan COVID-19 survey
R code for data cleaning and analysis of an survey of COVID-19 related health beliefs and behaviors among international students in Taiwan. 

# How this is organized
- The best way to understand what I've done so far is to look at the data_cleaning_master_script.R in the cleaning_scripts folder. It calls other scripts using the source() function
- The best file to look at to see how I've combined values is the variable_merger.R file that's also in the cleaning_scripts folder
- This github website is where I'll put any updates and changes to the code
- I can add SSPS syntax code to a seperate folder
- If you create a github account, I can make you a colaborater which would allow you to make changes to files and also to set the repository to private so that we can share data

# 中文説明
- 因爲電腦（尤其是windows)遇到中文的時候常常會發生一些編輯的問題，所以我習慣了盡量用英文寫程式碼。 如果有什麽不清楚的地方隨時可以問
- 如果看不懂R也可以問哈哈
- 我改天會把這個repository的説明翻譯成中文，但今天來不及。可以先參考以上的英文
