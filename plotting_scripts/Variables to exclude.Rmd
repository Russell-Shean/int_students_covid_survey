## R Markdown

Here are:
  - variables we can consider removing 
  - responses that we can consider combining
  

### hist_contactw14days_type

hist_contactw14days = Have you been in contact with someone who came to Taiwan in the last two weeks? 

Here are the range or responses, so I propose we eliminate this column without further analysis

```{r satu}
require(tibble)
as.tibble(table(int_students$hist_contactw14days_type,useNA = "ifany"))


```
